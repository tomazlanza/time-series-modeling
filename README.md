# Time Series Modeling

## About the work and its target audience
    
The work presented on this page, which was delivered in **June 2023**, consists of on-demand assessments and modellings for the behaviour of Brazil’s main inflation indexes, IPCA and IGP-M, over the following quarter.
    
Given that it was tailored to assist the directory board of a mutual-assistance organization related to a high bureaucracy career of Minas Gerais state, it comprises rather technical writing - thus, it was not designed to dialogue with a lay audience.
    
The entire report contains as its two parts (i) the presentation of the results and (ii) the  discussion on modelling - the translation of which is still ongoing - is available jointly with the R scripts that were developed for the task.
    
## Comments on the results
    
Looking from the future, I deem my assessments of the models and of their outcomes to be close to how things really went on, although the historically volatile IGP-M values have been overestimated both by myself and their model.

I considered *“the most likely scenario for the behavior of the IPCA 12-month variation (..) not significantly surpassing the 5% threshold”* in the end of the third quarter of 2023, meaning that the ponctual projection of 6.30% of the model would be *“overestimated by around one percentage point”*. My evaluation was pertinent, given that IPCA whole-year variation turned out to be **5.19%** in September.

For the IGP-M, its whole-year variation by September was **-5.97%**, around two percentage points less than the observed **-3.92%** value.

My overview then was that the long decline in inflation indicators from their 2021 height were probably going to persist in the few months ahead, due to a number of factors that I saw as likely trends, like the following:
* a better functioning of the state institutions than that of the previous years;
* a relative stagnation of geopolitical tensions;
* a continuity of the fall of inflation expectations, which had been decreasing for several months;
* a relatively stable exchange rate, despite the sharp rise of US Fed interest rates.
    
If all of the above were going to be more or less true, the less volatile scenario would lead to a greater likelihood of the indexes having a predictable behaviour.
    
Very much unfortunately, if I were to repeat the task now, as in **October 2023**, the current heartbreaking tensions in the Middle East blur the near future in a way that the statistical confidence levels for both indexes would have to be significantly reduced.

## A brief note on *"model lands"*

Lastly, I would like to cite a fragment of professor Erica Thompson’s interview on her book *"Escape From Model Land: How Mathematical Models Can Lead Us Astray and What We Can Do About It"* for The Actuary magazine (THE ACTUARY, 2023):

*“Instead of writing in your report ‘the model says X will happen’, you have to say, ‘I believe X will happen.’ You have to own the judgment of the model. That’s getting out of model land. That’s making an expert judgment that your model is correct or that it is wrong in a certain way.“*
